**Flashback**

"*2001 and it's graduation day, I can't believe I'm graduating as a Software Engineer, I mean I just survived Y2K*" beaming with excitement "*I am ready to enter the real world and start working for one of the top tech companies on my wish list."*

**Reflection**

As a young woman in tech, I faced many challenges along the way. One of the biggest challenges was my very first interview with a panel of men who questioned my abilities and knowledge. They asked me why I believed that I would be a good fit for their company and posed further, more complicated technical questions, as they couldn't believe that I knew to build in any of the programming languages I listed on my resume. That was also how I came to understand the term "pay parity".

In those days I was wilful and tended to seek employment opportunities every 2 years, because of the tedious tasks that would be deemed worthy of my abilities. Going back to my wish list, at the very top were IBM, Oracle, and Vodafone. While I was not able to work for IBM or Oracle that early on, I did have the opportunity to work with Vodafone Business Solutions. As part of my job description, I would need to use sim cards for satellite tracking. In the early 2000s, you could not buy a sim contract without a mobile device, so I usually ended up with 700 cellular phones ranging from Sony Ericsson's to Blackberry smartphones, finding innovative ways to market them.

*Always believing that the next job would be better. Always disheartened.*

I was once given a live coding task whilst in an interview to prove that I knew how to code. While male colleagues there for the same interview stated that they did not get any such task. It left me feeling inadequate and incapable despite being successful at the task at hand. This was a clear indication of the gender imbalance that existed in the tech industry.

However, getting to where I am today wasn't easy. Yes, it's 2023, but while more and more women are successfully entering the tech industry, it is still male-dominated, and we all need to recognize the vital role that women play in achieving the highest levels of digital maturity. It is not just about encouraging young girls to opt for STEM careers, but also empowering women in STEM to periodically upskill themselves and move towards successful career journeys. We have so many talented women in the tech space, and along with all the other accomplished women out there, they provide different ways to learn and lead in the field.

Even though at the start of my career my journey was rocky, I was fortunate enough to work in gender-balanced teams and have even been part of all-female teams. These experiences taught me that it's not about gender, it's about your abilities, talent and competencies, a diverse team brings a wealth of knowledge, skills, and perspectives that can only benefit the company and its clients.

As I look back on my journey, I am proud of how far I have come as a "Woman in Tech". I hope that my story can inspire other women to pursue their dreams and not let the gender imbalance deter them. We need more women in tech to create a more equitable and innovative future.
