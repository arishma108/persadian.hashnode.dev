People all around the world are doing interesting work with software, nanomaterials, biotechnology, artificial intelligence, robotics, computing, energy, electronics, and the internet. 

**Who am I? **
Well, I am a Software Engineer turned Educator u-turned Tech Entrepreneur *(all in the time-lapse of 15 years)* with a driving focus on Emerging Technologies.

**I'm passionate about**
Education | Agriculture | My Carbon Footprint

How am I any different from distinguished scientists, entrepreneurs, humanitarians, and business innovators?

Just like every other Tech Entrepreneur that came before me, I am employing technology in a new or interesting way, attempting to making advances in the most important areas of innovation, ones which can help us all see the new direction technology might take in the near future.

Deciding to pivot into the Tech space again seemed like a mammoth task and you can read all about that here:  [Medium](https://drpersadh.medium.com/darshani-persadh-a-south-african-entrepreneur-driving-r-d-innovation-technology-lionesses-of-64e08f0a6302) 

Most importantly: hashnode **OR**  [dev.to](https://dev.to/persadian) ?
As a programmer/developer it just seems smarter to use them both! 

I am looking forward to reading all your articles, learning new things and exchanging ideas with the hashnode community.
